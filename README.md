Memory Games is an interactive game where players test their memory by finding pairs of cards. The game offers two difficulty modes: Easy and Hard. Each pair found awards points, and players have a limited number of lives to complete the game.

To do this we will use the application "Apache NetBeans IDE" version 22, with the

java language, version 17.0.1.

and open in the libraries the file "mysql-connector-j-9.0.0.jar" to conect to the data base.
